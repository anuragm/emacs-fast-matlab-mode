# MATLAB mode for EMacs

This is my fork of the MATLAB mode for Emacs, found at [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/matlab-emacs/). Additionally, code is inspired and borrowed from MATLAB mode forks matintained by [Oleh](https://github.com/abo-abo/matlab-mode) and [Honglin Yu](https://github.com/yuhonglin/matlab-mode).

##Features

* MATLAB mode for MATLAB .m code editing
* MATLAB shell to use Matlab command line from EMacs.
* Completion at point functions that can interface with Company mode.
* Code checking and highlighting via Flycheck mode.

##Requirement

Configure variables to point to the MATLAB binary.
